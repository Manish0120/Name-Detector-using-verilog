# Name-Detector-using-verilog


In this file, I have implemented a name detector. Which takes input in ascii format and gives different outputs at different stages.
This project is for detecting my complete name "Manish Kumar".
It shows output as '2021UEE0146' when detects the name completely,
after detecting half of my name correctly it shows 'UG_EE_2021',
and 'IIT Jammu' in other cases.
